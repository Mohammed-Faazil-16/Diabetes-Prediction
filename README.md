Diabetes-Prediction focuses on building a predictive model to assess the probability of diabetes in individuals based on demographic and health-related data. Leveraging numpy and pandas for data manipulation and sklearn for logistic regression, the project aims to provide personalized risk assessments. By analyzing factors such as age, body mass index (BMI), family history, and lifestyle habits, the model helps identify individuals at higher risk of developing diabetes. This information enables healthcare providers to offer targeted interventions such as lifestyle modifications, screening programs, or medical treatments, thereby improving patient outcomes and reducing healthcare costs associated with diabetes management.
